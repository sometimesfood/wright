wright is Ruby
==============

While you can use wright without knowing too much about Ruby,
understanding that wright scripts are just plain Ruby helps a lot
finding your way around wright.

So how is wright Ruby? Let me count the ways...

Interpreter and DSL
-------------------

Typically wright scripts use an interpreter line such as the one below
to set `wright(1)` as the script interpreter.

[source,ruby]
----
#!/usr/bin/env wright
directory '~/this/is/a/directory' do |d|
  d.mode = '440'
end
----

If you do not want to use the wright interpreter, you can rewrite the
script above to use wright as a library.

[source,ruby]
----
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'wright'
extend Wright::DSL

directory '~/this/is/a/directory' do |d|
  d.mode = '440'
end
----

The `extend Wright::DSL` line makes wright DSL methods such as
`directory` available, which are a shorthand for instantiating a
resource and performing its default action. If you do not want to use
the DSL, you can also use the underlying resources in the following
way.

[source,ruby]
----
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'wright'

dir = Wright::Resource::Directory.new('~/this/is/a/directory')
dir.mode = '440'
dir.create
----

Manipulating resources
----------------------

The DSL methods mentioned above return proper wright resource objects,
so you can just save them for later use.

[source,ruby]
----
this_is_a_directory = directory '~/this/is/a/directory' do |d|
  d.mode = '440'
end
this_is_a_directory.class
# => Wright::Resource::Directory
----

This is especially handy, since you can name a resource so that you
can re-use it later in the update action of another resource.

Update actions
--------------

If you want to perform a specific action every time a resource
changes, you can use the `on_update` attribute. Since wright is just
Ruby, you can simply set `on_update` to a `proc` or a `lambda` (or
anything else that responds to `call` message, for that matter).

[source,ruby]
----
file '/etc/foobard.conf' do |f|
  f.content   = "# foobard config\n"
  f.on_update = -> { `service foobard restart` }
end
----

One-line resources
------------------
While multi-line resources are fine for more involved resource
definitions, one-line resource definitions can be more succinct for
simple definitions.

[source,ruby]
----
file('/etc/foobard.conf') { |f| f.action = :remove }
----

Dry-run mode
------------

Since wright scripts are just Ruby, wright's dry-run mode only affects
wright resources. If you want to make sure not to shoot yourself in
the foot, it's probably a good idea to respect dry-run mode whenever
you manipulate your system's state in your scripts using Ruby.

This script does not respect dry-run mode and will happily delete
`/tmp/foo`, even when run in dry-run mode:

[source,ruby]
----
#!/usr/bin/env wright
File.delete('/tmp/foo')
----

In order to change this script so that it does not touch your system
in dry-run mode, you can use the `Wright::dry_run?` method.

[source,ruby]
----
#!/usr/bin/env wright
File.delete('/tmp/foo') unless Wright.dry_run?
----

Of course, the best way to achieve dry-run awareness in this situation
would be to restrict yourself to using only wright's built-in
resources, which all support dry-run mode out of the box.

[source,ruby]
----
#!/usr/bin/env wright
file('/tmp/foo') { |f| f.action = :remove }
----

Distributing wright scripts
---------------------------

Looking for a way to package and distribute your wright scripts? Since
wright is just Ruby, you can simply use Ruby gems to package, version
and distribute your wright scripts. (Don't forget to add wright as a
runtime dependency to your gemspec!)
