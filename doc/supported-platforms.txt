Supported Platforms
===================

wright currently fully supports the following platforms:

- OS X
- Debian
- Ubuntu
- RHEL/Centos â‰¥7
- Fedora
- OpenBSD

Untested platforms
------------------
While other Unix-like operating systems such as FreeBSD, NetBSD or
GNU/Linux distributions not listed above are not tested at the moment,
wright should in principle be able to run on these platforms.

One major caveat is that since there are currently no providers for
the user, group or package resource for these systems, only basic
resources such as the file, directory or symlink resource can be used.

Unsupported platforms
---------------------
There are no plans for a Windows version of wright.

Since wright requires at least Ruby 1.9, there is no support for
systems that still rely on Ruby 1.8, such as RHEL 6/CentOS 6. If you
want to use wright on a system that does not have Ruby 1.9 packages,
you have to install Ruby 1.9 via a third-party repository.
