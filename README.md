Lightweight configuration management.

Getting Started
---------------
Performing simple administrative tasks with wright is easy.

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env wright

package 'sudo'

file '/etc/sudoers.d/env_keep-editor',
     content: "Defaults env_keep += EDITOR\n",
     owner:   'root:root',
     mode:    '440'
```

Scripts can also be run directly from the shell.

    wright -e "package 'tmux'"

If you would rather see the effects of running a wright script first,
use the dry-run option:

    wright --dry-run -e "package 'tmux'"

For a list of command-line parameters, see
[the manpage][wright-manpage]. For a more in-depth list of tasks you
can perform using wright, check the [resource list][wright-resources].

Installation
------------
Since wright does not have any runtime dependencies apart from Ruby
â‰¥1.9, it can safely be installed system-wide via rubygems:

    sudo gem install wright

Installation on Debian-based systems
------------------------------------
If you use a Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution such as Ubuntu, you
can also install wright via the PPA [sometimesfood/wright][ppa]:

    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:sometimesfood/wright
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install wright

If you use a Debian-based distribution that is not Ubuntu, you have to
update your apt sources manually before installing wright:

    export DISTRO="$(lsb_release -sc)"
    export PPA_LIST="sometimesfood-wright-${DISTRO}.list"
    sudo sed -i "s/${DISTRO}/trusty/g" /etc/apt/sources.list.d/${PPA_LIST}
