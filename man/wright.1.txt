NAME
----
wright - lightweight config management utility


SYNOPSIS
--------
*wright* ['OPTIONS'] 'FILE' ['ARGUMENT'...]

*wright* ['OPTIONS'] *-e* 'COMMAND' ['ARGUMENT'...]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
wright is a lightweight configuration management utility. It can be
used to perform common sysadmin tasks such as installing packages,
creating files, setting up groups and users and so on by running short
Ruby scripts.

Although wright is typically used to run script files, it can also
execute short code snippets passed on the command line. Another way to
run wright scripts is to make your script executable and use wright as
the interpreter by setting an appropriate "#!" line.


OPTIONS
-------
*-e* 'COMMAND'::
    Run 'COMMAND' as a wright script. When multiple commands are
    passed, they are joined and run in sequence.

*-r* 'LIBRARY'::
    Require 'LIBRARY' before running the wright script. When multiple
    libraries are passed, they are loaded in sequence.

*-n, --dry-run*::

    Enable dry-run mode. In dry-run mode, wright resources do not
    modify the system, but you still have to make sure your own code
    does not cause any unwanted changes.

*-v, --verbose*::
    Print debugging information.

*-q, --quiet*::
    Suppress non-error output.

*--version*::
    Print wright version.


EXAMPLES
--------
Install tmux via the system package manager:

 wright -e 'package "tmux"'

Create a system user named "foobard":

 wright -e 'user "foobard", system: true'

Create a system group named "foobard":

 wright -e 'group "foobard", system: true'

Create a file named '/etc/issue' containing the current wright
version:

 wright -e 'file "/etc/issue", content: Wright::VERSION'

Create a directory named '/tmp/foo/bar/baz':

 wright -e 'directory "/tmp/foo/bar/baz"'

Create a symlink from '.bash_profile' to '.profile' in the current
user's home directory:

 wright -e 'symlink "~/.bash_profile", to: "~/.profile"'

To install tmux and update its config file from a wright script,
create the following file:

----
package 'tmux'

file '/etc/tmux.conf',
     mode: '444',
     on_update: -> { puts 'Updated /etc/tmux.conf' },
     content: <<EOF
unbind C-b
set -g prefix C-a
bind-key a send-prefix
EOF
----

When saved as 'install-tmux.rb', the script can then be run via

 wright --quiet install-tmux.rb

wright can also be used as an interpreter. The example below
creates and runs a standalone wright script:

----
cat <<EOF > create-dir.rb
#!/usr/bin/env wright
directory '/tmp/foo/bar/baz'
EOF
chmod +x create-dir.rb
./create-dir.rb
